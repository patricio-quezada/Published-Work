**What You Will See Differently Than Other Commands.** Many of the “classic artifacts” of command do not accurately reflect the dynamic nature of our work. We know where we want to take the organization but the route to getting there is not a straight line. Some of our experiments will not pan out and often we will need to take a few steps back and try alternative routes to get to our destination. We understand how important it is to know where we are going. So instead of a traditional “command guidance” we have decided to share our next “chapter” with you. This allows us to remain flexible and responsive to our evolving needs of and the dynamic landscape of the National Capital Region (NCR).

**Our next chapter: Our focus for the rest of 2024.** Our primary goal for the remainder of 2024 is to make our organization a welcoming place for incoming Soldiers. This involves looking at our entire “onboarding” process when new teammates arrive to the organization, how we build our teams, and enriching our relationships on Fort Meade.

We are dividing our work into a set of priority tasks:
### Unit Onboarding

We are excited about this next chapter of our story. While we cannot predict everything that will happen for the rest of the year, this overview should provide a good idea of our current focus areas. It also indicates what we probably will not get around to until future chapters. We appreciate your continued support and feedback as we work towards making our organization the best in the NCR. Together, we are building the future of the Military Police Corps. We will share updates as we progress through this chapter and thank you for being part of our team.
