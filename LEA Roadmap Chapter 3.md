**What you Will See Differently in Year 2.** There is an inherent sense of urgency when you plan to command for only one year. The challenge is to focus on things that are important to the organization but also things that can be accomplished within the year. I was offered the opportunity to stay one more year as the commander of both LEA and 2d. After talking with my family, we unanimously chose to stay at least another year. I am excited to have the rare opportunity to continue building on the worked we started last July.

**How Far We’ve Come**

Whether you believe it or not, the organization has changed. When we received information that we would change from an MTOE to a TDA, we knew that it was a great opportunity to change. We chose to make incremental changes while also allowing enough time to react to the changing environment both on and outside Fort Meade. We focused on quarters rather than months and each phase into Chapters.

Each Chapter since October had a theme:
- ***LEA Roadmap Chapter 1*** where the focus was to welcome new members and establish new processes. During that time, we identified our lack of an onboarding process, we observed our team dynamics and learn about our relationship with the DES and JTF-NCR.
- ***LEA Roadmap Chapter 2*** where the focus was on changing and improving those processes and team dynamics. We focused on sponsorship as the first impression a Soldier has of our organization. We worked with the DES to increase our training days and give the NCOs the time and space to be trainers.

In each chapter, we accomplished some critical tasks that allow us to be where we are today:

- **Unit Onboarding.** We made the Detachment Sergeant the ACT administrator because the sponsorship program is the First Sergeant’s responsibility. We also started work on our unit SharePoint site which will be the way Soldiers coming to the unit find information about who we are and what we do.
- **Team Building.** This is where we made the biggest improvement, and I can honestly say this is the most connected I have seen both LEA and 2d. We shifted our focus from Operations to Training, put an NCO to work alongside the DES Training Officer, and gained experience with training management.
- **Law Enforcement Enterprise.** We focused on using the upcoming Full Scale Exercise to integrate our capabilities within the DES and Garrison. We will learn a lot from the Full Scale Exercise and I am looking forward to those lessons.

**Our next chapter: Fortification.** The primary goal is to **solidify the changes and improvements made over the last two quarters, making them robust and reliable.** This involves **creating, reviewing, and updating policy letters, continuity documents, and leader development.**

My family and I are excited to continue this chapter in our lives with the Dragoon & Watchdog family. While I cannot predict everything that will happen over the next quarter, this should provide a good idea of our focus areas moving forward. It also indicates what we probably will not get around until future chapters. I will echo what I said in Chapter 1, ***“We appreciate your continued support and feedback as we work towards making our organization the best in the NCR. Together, we are building the future of the Military Police Corps.”***
