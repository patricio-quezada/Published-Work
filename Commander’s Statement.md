## Who we are
We believe that leadership is a verb. That’s why we reaffirm our commitment to ourselves, our unit, and the Constitution. Throughout our service, we practice understanding, clear communication, compromise, and dedication to mission accomplishment.
## Our aim
We believe we are one of the best Military units in the National Capital Region (NCR). That’s why our aspiration is captured in our motto “Without Equal…Challenge Accepted.”
## Our mission
We **ASSIST**, **PROTECT**, and **DEFEND** the Soldiers, Civilians, and Families within the Joint Operating Area (JOA). That’s why we are **on call** whenever we are requested, **on guard** whenever it is our turn, and **on mission** whenever we are asked to support any mission within the JOA.
## Our commitment
When in doubt, **think like a leader and set the example**. That’s why at times, **either be a leader or grow a leader.** In the absence of guidance, do what will accomplish our mission - legally, morally, and ethically - while bringing honor to yourself, your family, our community, and team.
