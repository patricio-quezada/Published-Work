Good morning Colonel Gore, Command Sergeant Major Moore, Lieutenant Colonel Yama, Command Sergeant Major Krese, and teammates.

I am honored to stand in front of you as the last 241st Military Police Detachment Commander. More importantly, I am honored to have an incredible group of men and women standing in formation paying respect to this unit's history and accomplishments. Today we honor our past, our present, and our future.
### To our past
Our organization has lineage in Virginia, New Jersey, Colorado, and Maryland. Since our constitution our purpose has been rooted in protecting garrison functions from medical centers to training centers during World War II.

If you all ever have time, at our detachment HQ there are many photos, yes black and white photos, paying homage to our history.

In its current configuration, the 241st Military Police Detachment has existed for almost 22 years. We have supported the residents of Fort Meade, the National Capital Region, and combatant commanders without fail. Many of our teammates at the Fort Meade DES once served as members of the 241st Military Police Detachment.
### To our present
Our unit is currently serving in three lines of effort: on call, on guard, and on mission. We are on call for at any moment's notice we can be called to deploy in support of a combatant commander worldwide. We are on guard where every day Soldiers from the 241st Military Police Detachment call in for service to support and defend the residents of Fort Meade and their families. We are on mission where alongside many other units across the NCR we help bolster the security posture during national security special events or other missions as ordered.

We are unique. There are not many like us and we embrace the uniqueness each and every day.
### To our future
We cannot predict what the future environment may look like for us but here we are on the precipice of another change in response to the landscape changing around us. We are ready to continue the mission of providing law enforcement support to Fort Meade and the National Capital Region. What I will implore today as I close is to remind everyone that when that one day comes where Team Meade needs to be at our best - we should not allow our past nor present prevent us from charting new courses, re-establishing broken relationships, and asking tough questions of ourselves and others on how we can keep each of us safe in a midst of chaos.

Thank you for being a part of our unit's history today and thank you all for your service.

**Without Equal! Heed the Guardian! Support & Defend.**
