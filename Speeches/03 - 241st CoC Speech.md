## Introduction
Good morning Colonel Sapp, Command Sergeant Major Moore, Lieutenant Colonel Cook, Lieutenant Colonel Yama, Command Sergeant Major Krese, family, friends, and guests.
Until about 10 AM today the most important objective in my life was to make sure my family made it to THIS change of command on time, and I can successfully report that they are all here, all four children; wait…am I missing one? Nope, we got the entire team here.

## Army Birthday and Flag Day
Today holds special significance as we celebrate the Army’s birthday and Flag Day. The Army’s birthday is a reminder of over two centuries of dedication, sacrifice, and unwavering service to our nation. It’s a testament to our legacy and the relentless spirit that defines us as Soldiers. Flag Day, on the other hand, is a celebration of our national unity and the values our flag represents. As we gather here near the stars and stripes, we are reminded of the ideals of liberty, justice, and freedom that we are sworn to protect.
## To MDW
I am deeply honored to be part of the Military District of Washington again. The name suggests the importance of our mission. The security challenges facing our nation are complex, unremitting and compelling, and addressing them requires complete focus, effective partnerships and synchronized efforts. The ability of these detachments to respond when called depends on the skill and dedication of the great men and women serving all over the National Capital Region.

Answering the call means we must provide a safe, secure, effective, and ready security force. Answering the call means we must work with installation commanders to provide capabilities to support ongoing operations. Answering the call means we must ensure that Soldiers responding to people’s good and bad days have the support and trust to be resilient. And answering the call means we must help enhance our ability to work together and tell our Army story.
## Thank You
Thank you Colonel Sapp for your leadership of Fort Meade and for the opportunities and mentorship that prepared me to stand here this morning. Our time together is ticking but I thank you for the conversations in your office and thank you for advocating for me when I was not in the room. That means a lot.

Thank you Lieutenant Colonel Cook for your kind words, your mentorship, and leadership to the Soldiers of the Axehammer battalion. Thank you for believing in my ability to effect change and to do the work we set out to do when you first arrived. I hope I can repay the confidence you have in me through diligent work and purposeful mentorship.
## Family and Friends
To my family and friends, thank you all for making the drive to share this moment with me. I am honored to continue to share my Army story with you all.

To all our other distinguished guests and friends, both military and civilians, thank you for joining us today.
## Footsteps of CPT Cooke
I find myself again following a great leader, Captain Breona Cooke. Cook-E as Command Sergeant Major Moore coined it, your leadership and service has allowed the Soldiers in this formation to protect the Fort Meade community, support the NCR, and the Nation.

I am honored to take up your legacy at the detachments. I was able to watch you learn, grow, and lead; it is rare to work alongside the person you are going to replace for 14 months. The sacrifice you and Jas made to this organization will be forever remembered.

Well done battle.

And please know that Cora and I wish you, Jas, and your family all the best as you explore the city life. We hope to continue to count the Cookes’ among our many friends.
## Challenge and Opportunity
And now to the Soldiers negotiating today’s heat index.

For every challenge there are opportunities, and together we will adjust to the major challenges facing the command. We will work with the other detachments, installations, and mission partners to bring our capabilities to bear. We will look to craft new approaches to difficult problems of protection and safety. We will provide unwavering support to our Soldiers and their families who bear the heaviest burden of service and sacrifice.
## Detachments
To the Soldiers and families of the 241st and 2d Military Police Detachments - you are all outstanding.

It is an honor take charge of this office. I do not take this responsibility lightly and I look forward to meaningful conversations, advocating for your development, and continuing to learn how to be a leader from you all. All Soldiers are entitled to outstanding leadership. I hope to provide that leadership.
## Cora, Rarity, and Closing
Cora, the kids and I are excited to rejoin the Dragoon-Watchdog family and we look forward to all we will accomplish together. It is an honor and a privilege to serve alongside you.

It is rare to have two commands. It is even rarer to have one change of command on my birthday. It is even rarer to have another change of command on your kid’s birthday…Happy Birthday Wesley!

I am energized, well rested, and I have less hair to lose than I did 14 months ago. There are many amazing Army stories out in the crowd today - former Commanders, West Point classmates, retired Command Sergeants Major, a retired Force Recon Marine, police officers, and many more examples of dedication, sacrifice, and service to our nation.

I am glad to call you all teammates and I am sure you will be there to make sure I do not mess it up; LET’S GET TO WORK!

Without Equal. Be Fluid. Heed the Guardian. This We’ll Defend.

Thank you!
