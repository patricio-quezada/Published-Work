# HHC Assumption of Responsibility
Good morning Command Sergeant Major Welch, Lieutenant Colonel Cook, Command Sergeant Major Sanders, directorates, guests, friends, and family, thank you for attending HHC's Assumption of Responsibility ceremony.

What brings us all together in this room today is that we are here for someone other than ourselves. So I am going to take a few moments to speak on behalf SFC Felder, our most recent First Sergeant and welcome First Sergeant Lowery and her family.

## To SFC Felder
- Since 2019, HHC has had various senior NCOs assume the role of senior advisors to HHC Commanders. The position is unique because it demands innovation, determination, and unity.
- Our most recent First Sergeant, Sergeant First Class Clifford J. Felder or CJ as he reluctantly disliked to be called, is responsible for reestablishing the legitimate power of the unit First Sergeant. He is immensely proud of the growth and milestones achieved during his time as the unit First Sergeant. Whether it was transporting detainees, out-processing senior leaders, handing over Soldiers to civilian law enforcement, volunteering in the city of Baltimore, it was was done with the utmost professionalism.
- A little over 180 days as a command team together, Sergeant First Class Felder had to take an extended absence to take care of his health. His unexpected absence left the unit a bit shaken. We rallied behind his traditional NCO style, we adapted in the best way we could, and our successes today are shaped by his influence and leadership. His reflections on his time in HHC and as an Axehammer are marked by divergent thinking, enabling Soldiers to use divergent thinking, but most importantly that "the job is about the people in our formations, take care of your people and they will take care of you."
- I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the Kelsey Felder, Sergeant First Class Felder's wife, and his four girls, Brianna, Mia, Gabriella, and Olivia. I believe that a true mark of a man is in his acts of love for his family. It is evident in his character that he loves you all more than he loves himself. The principles he brought with him to work - hard work, dedication, and integrity were all possible because of your support, your ability to make him laugh regardless of how his day went, and patience.
- On a personal note, thank you for being a role model for the company and father figure to draw from for me. Our relationship does not end here and I am now the second commander who you've co-opted into your famous "CMD Team lunches" or "Morning Talks". I will miss those moments with you. May the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ continue to bless you and your family.
- Can we all please give the Felder family a round of applause {applaud}

## To 1SG Lowery
- Since today is a historic day in HHC, I want to touch on a bit of history as it relates to the rank of First Sergeant.
- The First Sergeant rank can be traced back to the Roman Army where "First Sergeants" served as the right arm of the centurion and were referred to as the "standard bearer." They were also responsible for the guidon, the health and welfare of Soldiers, and the administration of the company.
- As time went on, the First Sergeant become akin to the the Feldwebel {Felt-Vee-Bel} or the "Mother of Company"
- First Sergeants kept the Company Commander informed, monitored NCO duty performance, and maintained personnel accountability.
- The most interesting fact of 1SG history is that they were the only noncommissioned officers allowed to strike a Soldier.
- Why did I just babble on about First Sergeant history at an assumption of responsibility ceremony?
- For years, we've had NCOs fulfill the duties I alluded to but never a First Sergeant.
- Now, 1SG Lowery, you are that First Sergeant, the maintainer of the continuity. While a familiar face to Fort Meade, we would like to formally welcome you, Martez, Jahmai, Jayda, and Jhylan to the Spartan family.
- The stakes as the HHC First Sergeant can not be any higher, but with your your grit, you will rise to the challenge AND succeed. But remember whenever you feel overwhelmed there will always be a Chik-Fil-A mentorship lunch, at least for the next 45-ish days.
- If I may take a moment to directly address you, First Sergeant Lowery, I am grateful and honored for you to be the HHC First Sergeant, the standard bearer, the Mother of the Company, the maintainer of continuity. I look forward to our time as a command team together.
- Congratulations from my family, the Felder family, and the HHC family! Winning Matters!
