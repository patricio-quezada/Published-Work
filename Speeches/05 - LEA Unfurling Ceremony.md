# Unfurling Ceremony

Good morning Colonel Danner, Colonel Gore, Lieutenant Colonels Yama, Griffith, and Reynolds, Major Smith, Command Sergeants Major Moore and Krese, Chief Alveris, Master Sergeant Molczan, the PMO Team, friends, families, and honored guests. Thank you for making the time to be here today. It is rare to have all the key stakeholders in one room.

I will be honest, I was not sure how the changeover to an LEA would go or how to explain it to the formation or anyone else. Today I am going to try.  Switching to the LEA has been like switching conferences in college football. Let us take the Army Black Knights. They played independently for much of their existence and now they are the American Athletic Conference (AAC) conference champions.

I cannot help but draw parallels to the changes I have witnessed as the Commander of this organization.
- We have new NCOICs who have stepped up to be “team captains” in our organization.
- We have more to “fight for” now that many of us welcomed mini-Dragoons (new babies) over the last 90 days (my count is at 6 to include LT Blount and SGT Pennifill)
- Former Dragoons serving in key positions across the NCR and many who continue to serve in our Army.
- Newer NCOs eager to mentor our young leaders.

The legacy of the 241st Military Police Detachment steadies our resolve and our re-commitment to the Joint Task Force’s mission silently guides our every deed. We understand that our story is beginning and that this organization’s history is shaped by our words and our actions, we recommit to stand on guard, on call, and on mission.

Similarly to how Army beat Navy at the High Intensity Interval Training at Nats Park on Tuesday; and how Army Football is going to embarrass the Navy football team on Saturday; this LEA wants to show the installations and the NCR that we are not here for a participation trophy...we are here to win. 

Beat Navy!
