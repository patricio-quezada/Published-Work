# HHC Change of Command
Last week, I was in Los Angeles, California.

This was my true second graduation but my first non-military graduation. But I was not the only one.

I along with many others sat in the middle of Allyson Felix field celebrating an accomplishment with each other; many who did not have a high school prom, a high school graduation, or other traditions customarily to graduations. As I sat in my seat, I could not but reflect on my time in command and how similar it is to the experience I was having at that moment.

I sat in a sea full of students completing different degrees, of different ages, and from different places. Despite those differences, I felt connected to them through legacy, service, and teamwork.

Command does not necessarily break you down, it breaks you open. It can, if you let it, show you who you really are in this type of role. But if you don’t know yourself going in or make the effort to find out during the experience, the joy of command can be a worthless.

If you cannot choose relationships wisely, spend money wisely, or seek out mentorship wisely, this experience can begin to mean not much at all. So I challenge everyone in the room, to lean into every duty assignment including this one with that frame of mind. I encourage you all to seek out others who are moving in the direction you want to go whether it’s in Army or in life. Command is not really about emails or colors on a PowerPoint slide, it’s about who we are and what we bring to the Army. The Army evaluates performance but promotes on potential which is shaped by character.

These are stressful times. But I’m confident that we will, as Team Meade and an Army, endure because of people like you sitting in this room; families, friends, loved ones, and children. Command is stressful and frustrating but I feel uplifted today looking at many of the faces I stood shoulder to shoulder with to solve problems while I was in this command; future leaders, future NCOs, future officers, future Army Civilians.

My charge to everyone today is succession. I want everyone to take a moment to look to your left, your right, and behind you. There are people of different ranks, different ranks, different ages, and different skin tones. If you are in this room and you are wise of age, someone you just looked at will replace you, they may process your retirement paperwork one day, they may process your VA claim, or may hire your child or grandchild. Legacy is watching. Everything we do is being watched. If you all run out of here right after the ceremony without connecting with someone you did not know before today, you are setting an example; signaling to the younger folks in the room. Your presence means something.
There’s a quote by James Baldwin where he says “The world is before you and you need not take it or leave it as it was when you came in.” This unit just came out of one the most interesting time in history four years ago. But you got to leave it better than you found it. So what does that look like for you? What does giving back look like for you? What will your legacy be? How will you move forward? If we keep moving forward by ourselves, we’ll move really fast especially here, but you won’t go far.

Thank you all for your presence here today. I hope to stay connected with each of you in whatever capacity allows us to be connected. I hope to see everyone on June 14th on the McGlachlin Parade Field as I inherit CPT Cooke’s legacy as the Commander of the 241st Military Police Detachment and 2d Military Police Detachment (Military Working Dogs).
